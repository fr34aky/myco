# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-02)

**Core value:** Phones in the same room connect to each other, reliably, without the user doing anything.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Make Peering Observable

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Make Peering Observable)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-04 — Roadmap created for Milestone A (24 v1 requirements across 5 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Instrumentation (Phase 1) precedes peering fixes (Phase 2) — root causes are inferred from code, not confirmed by device logs.
- [Roadmap]: Reason codes (DIAG-02) land last inside Phase 2, after churn/reconnect is sane — reasons on top of flaky reconnect are noise.
- [Roadmap]: Phases 1-3 are inside the 2026-08-05 release deadline; Phases 4-5 (fips rebase, core health) land after it and must not gate the release.
- [Roadmap]: fips rebase is theme-by-theme with a per-theme timebox — drop themes that fight the refactor, never one mechanical rebase.

### Pending Todos

None yet. Field TODOs are tracked separately in `reference/FIX-TODOS.md`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Hard deadline:** demo 2026-08-04 (today), release 2026-08-05. The release ships only if mesh quality is measurably better than the current release — Phase 2 is that gate.
- **Unconfirmed root causes:** BLE role-tiebreaker race, advertise/scan duty-cycle asymmetry and fire-and-forget fan-out are inferred, not observed. Phase 1 exists to close this gap; do not start Phase 2 fixes on inference alone.
- **Vendor divergence:** convergence and churn recovery must be demonstrated on at least three vendors (Samsung + Xiaomi + Pixel); Pixel alone is not representative.
- **fips rebase risk:** 19 commits sit 232 commits behind a heavily refactored master; some themes likely dissolve entirely. Fallback is targeted fixes on `feat/platform-peer-queue`.

## Quick Tasks Completed

| ID | Task | Date | Branch | Summary |
|----|------|------|--------|---------|
| 260809-nyq | Myco deep linking (`myco://app/<host>/<path>`) + deferred open, and the myco-dumplings test nsite | 2026-08-09 | `feat/deep-links` | `.planning/quick/260809-nyq-myco-deep-linking-myco-app-host-path-def/SUMMARY.md` |
| 260818-l65 | Status pill: bigger, red when mesh off, easier switch, and a Circle/Mesh status panel behind it (per-lane scanning + per-peer ping/uptime/last-seen) | 2026-08-18 | `feat/status-pill-panel` | `.planning/quick/260818-l65-status-pill-panel/SUMMARY.md` |
| 260818-dnm | Device name: default to the phone's own name, one-tap chips for it and the generated one, and a 2048-wide SHA-256-keyed generator (was 144 with a correlated hash) | 2026-08-18 | `feat/status-pill-panel` | `.planning/quick/260818-dnm-device-name-defaults/SUMMARY.md` |
| 260818-fgt | First-run gating: radios and permission prompts wait for the intro; peer labels resolve to the name the peer actually chose | 2026-08-18 | `feat/status-pill-panel` | `.planning/quick/260818-fgt-first-run-gating/SUMMARY.md` |
| 260818-adv | Broadcast the chosen device name in the BLE scan response so Nearby shows it before pairing; fixed inbound-BLE advert attribution via transport_addr | 2026-08-18 | `feat/status-pill-panel` | `.planning/quick/260818-adv-advertised-names/SUMMARY.md` |
| 260821-cib | CI clones the fips `fix/platform-ble` branch instead of `integration/platform` (same mobile seams, rebased onto fips master, plus BLE PSM/dial-backoff fixes) | 2026-08-21 | `chore/ci-fips-platform-ble` | `.planning/quick/260821-cib-ci-fips-ref-platform-ble/SUMMARY.md` |

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Milestone B | MESH-01..04, BACK-01..05, WEB-01..04, NAP-01..08 | Deferred to Milestone B roadmap via `/gsd-new-milestone` | 2026-08-04 |
